**Server-based systems and methods for enabling interactive, collabortive thin-and no-client image-based applications**, Issued March 2007, US Patent: 11/688132

A server receives image, graphic and/or analytic data and processes and asynchronously outputs that data to a thin/no client. The server inputs image data in a variety of different formats and renders a normalized format that can be streamed to the thin/no client using light-weight protocol(s). The server updates the image, feature and/or analytic data in real time. The server inputs feature, analytic, business logic and other data and process it into
various format(s) that can be streamed to the thin/no client and overlaid on the image data.

The server provides application services, which can include collaboration, tracking, alerting,
business, workflow and/or other desired services. The server can receive collaboration data from one thin/no client and stream that collaboration data to other thin/no clients to enable
shared situational awareness between the thin/no clients. The server includes a programming environment for programming thin/no clients contained within server-based
web pages. 

**Analysis of time-based geospatial mashups using AD HOC visual queries**, Issued , December 2007, US Patent: 12/005334

An apparatus in one example has an analytical environment for mashup data having visual analysis metaphors, and linking and correlation functionality among the visual analysis metaphors. A system may have: at least one store having a predetermined floor plan layout; at least one predetermined location on the predetermined floor plan layout for displaying at least one product; analytical environment for mashup data having visual analysis metaphors, the mashup data formed from data indicative of the predetermined floor plan layout, and data indicated of sales of the at least one product; and linking and correlation functionality among the visual analysis metaphors through a web browser. In one example, a plurality of products may be positioned on a plurality of shelves, and may be depicted in a geographical display. Sales of each product may be depicted in a in time line display that is linked to the
geographical display.

**Systems and methods for visualizing arguments**, Issued , January 2006, US Patent: 11/331309

Hypotheses are questions of interest to an observer. Evidence are facts that establish or disprove hypotheses or sub-hypotheses. Inferences are logical links that connect facts to hypotheses as evidence. An argument is a set of facts linked by inferences to support or disprove a given hypothesis. Hypotheses, sub-hypothesis, facts, evidence, inference and arguments are visualized using a plurality of interrelated graphical user interfaces. A main visualization screen includes a fact visualization portion, a hypothesis visualization portion and an argument construction visualization portion. The evidence visualization portion comprises an evidence display portion, an evidence details portion and visualization selection widgets that allow different evidence visualization or marshaling techniques to be applied to visualize the facts. The argument construction visualization potion allows hypotheses, sub-hypotheses and conjectures to be associated into an argument, facts to be associated and inference links to be added to link the facts to various ones of the hypotheses.

**Platform for real-time tracking and analysis**, Issued , February 2008, US Patent: 12/070976

An apparatus in one example has: at least one of an identification tag and a video feed associated with at least one asset; at least one real time location server that operatively interfaces with the at least one of the identification tag and the video feed; and real-time data analysis and tracking system that ingests asset location data for at least one asset from at least one real time location server. The real time data analysis and tracking system may have a real-time alerting rules engine. Assets being tracked may be organized into at least categories and groups, the categories may be used to manipulate visibility of sets of assets in a portal, and the groups may be used by the real-time alerting rules engine.

**thincVIew™: Putting Visual Intelligence on the Map**, 2007
The focus of “Business Intelligence” is to enable corporations to analyze business data and gain insights that result in better business performance. One type of data that is underutilized by corporations is that involving locations. It is estimated that 80% of all data maintained by corporations has a location component, either directly involving longitude and latitude or indirectly by geo-encoding information such as addresses. To analyze geospatial business data, we have developed a thin client Web 2.0 AJAX platform called thincVIew™. Using thincVIew it is possible to develop rich mashup analytical sites. Although thincVIew is superficially similar to Google Maps and Microsoft’s Live Maps, the difference is
that thincVIew’s API is designed for analysis and correlation rather than providing directions and serving up ads. In this paper we describe thincVIew and illustrate its use in a retail case study analyzing customers and store locations and shelf-level inventory and sales performance.

**THINCTRAX IS A VISUALIZATION SYSTEM AND USER INTERFACE FOR REAL-TIME TRACKING OF ASSETS**, 2007

  thincTrax is a visualization system and user interface for real-time tracking of assets. It is able to connect to generic location servers such as GPS, RFID and other location systems, ingest the positions of assets, and display the information on a Web 2.0 AJAX map. The system includes new visualizations for asset positions, geo-fencing, real-time alerting, and other management tools to support real-time tracking applications. 

**Extending Mashups to Visualize Patterns in Temporal Data**, June 2007
Many datasets are now published as streams of time-stamped, geo-encoded events using GeoRSS. To understand patterns within this class of data, we have taken ideas from mashups and extended them to develop new visual components that present live geospatial data in novel ways. The components are interactive, live, linked and contain many novel features for understanding temporal and geospatial patterns in event data. The components are light-weight, thin client, Web 2.0 AJAX technology and are suitable for analyzing both on-line streaming and off-line static datasets. Our work expands traditional geospatial mashups to include timeline, time wheel, and graph mashups for real-time time streaming
data.

**Thin client visualization**, 2007
We have developed a Web 2.0 thin client visualization framework called GeoBoost™. Our framework focuses on geospatial visualization and using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), AJAX, RSS and GeoRSS we have built a complete thin client component set. Our component set provides a rich user experience that is completely browser based. It includes maps, standard business charts, graphs, and time-oriented components. The components are live, interactive, linked, and support real time collaboration.

**A WEB 2.0 FRAMEWORK FOR REAL-TIME LOCATION INTELLIGENCE**, 2007
Abstract – With increasing deployments of Global Positioning System (GPS) devices, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags, and other location-aware devices, it is now possible to capture time-varying object information. In addition, existing systems such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems emit ancillary object metadata (e.g., inventory levels in a warehouse). The challenge is how to leverage these information assets for demanding field operations scenarios such as Crisis Management, given the size and real-time nature of the data. To address the challenge, we have built a Web 2.0 framework for real-time spatial intelligence and collaboration. Our framework includes an extensible architecture for ingesting and combining spatial data across multiple formats; a fusion server for merging spatial and bespoke business data; support for spatial transformations tied to configurable business rules; and a publishing engine that pushes the combined information out for consumption in a visual, collaborative presentation layer running in standard Web browsers and on mobile devices. The result is an easily deployable system with broad reach to the field through a visual, interactive interface presenting timely, meaningful information.

**GEOBOOST: AN AJAX WEB 2.0 COLLABORATIVE GEOSPATIAL VISUALIZATION
FRAMEWORK**, 2006
Recently a new class of applications has emerged that uses AJAX and other web programming techniques to provide a rich user experience in a web browser. This class of applications is being called Web 2.0 and includes Google Maps and Google Suggest. To experiment with this approach, we have developed a Web 2.0 thin client collaborative visualization framework called GeoBoost™ that uses Scalable Vector Graphics and AJAX to provide a rich user experience built around collaboration. Our framework includes geospatial maps, standard business charts, node and link displays, and custom visual displays. All of our visualization components run in standard web browsers and provide rich interaction and collaboration.

**A TALE OF ALDERWOOD, A case study using DECIDE for intelligence analysis.**
Political corruption seems to be present in several forms: election tampering, unethical behavior, and deception all seem to be present in one form or another during the period of January 2002 – March 2004. Evidence of election tampering is present in the Alderwood Voter Registry. It appears that at least two different individuals have tampered with the registry. Both made mistakes which can be used to identify which records are fraudulent.
